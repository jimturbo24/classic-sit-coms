My thoughts on this presentation:
Slide 1
Did he film this in a cafeteria?

Slide 2
Resource Based means.....
Things vs. actions?
Nouns vs. Verbs?
Versus SOAP-RPC???
Do any of the above bullet points add any sort of value to the presentation or
are these simple his speaking notes?
What is a URI?
"Representation is not the resource, it's a representation of the resource"?
Has he already talked about what a representation is?
So what does resource based mean? It's noun based?

Slide 3
Resources get manipulated by representations in a restful architecture?
Representations represent the whole or part of the resource state?
A representation gets transferred between a client and a server?
Representations have metadata?
They can modify or delete the resource on a server? if it has permission?
Representations are typically JSON? or XML?
We'd use HTTP verbs on our person (noun)? Isn't rest noun based?
"Representation of a resources state that goes between...is transferred between
client and server...and general they are JSON or XML format"?

Slide 4
Complicated buzz words, really?
"We use the HTTP spec with URI's being our resource names and we use the HTTP
verbs as the actions that we're going to take on those resources, so that's a
complicated way of say'n it...."?
So uniform interface means we all use HTML? I thought he said we don't have to use
HTML to be restful?

Slide 5 & 6
What?
I think I'm done.
